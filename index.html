			<h2><a href="/message-privacy-security/">Message Privacy &amp; Security</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Jan 07, 2021</p>
			<p>It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of the many apps used to communicate in today's world, and while you might not pay much attention to the different options available, I want to share <em><strong>why you absolutely should!</strong></em></p>

			<h2><a href="/aws-elb-vs-haproxy/">AWS ELB vs HAProxy</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Aug 25, 2020</p>
			<p>If you're using AWS as your cloud provider, the chances are you're using their defacto ELB service to manage load balancing. It's got a big list of pros: easy to configure; scalable; free SSL; seamless EC2 integration. With the only real con being the expensiveness of running at scale, especially in front of multi-zone, large data-transfering services - or so I thought.</p>

			<h2><a href="/understanding-mutexes/">Understanding Mutexes</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Oct 22, 2019</p>
			<p>Those of us familiar with concurrency and parallelism know just how useful a mutex can be when protecting access to resources. But how do they work?</p>

			<h2><a href="/parallel-tests-go/">Parallel tests in Go</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Oct 8, 2019</p>
			<p>A great feature of Go is the ability to run tests in parallel using the default testing package.</p>

			<h2><a href="/kubecon-18/">KubeCon & CloudNativeCon - North America '18</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Dec 30, 2018</p>
			<img src="images/kubecon-18.jpg" title="KubeCon &amp; CloudNativeCon — North America ‘18" />
			<p>With a grand total of 8000 attendees, 150+ speakers, 250+ talks, 100+ sponsors and more swag than I've ever seen at a conference, this was an event not to be missed.</p>

			<h2><a href="/remote-cohesion/">Remote Cohesion</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Nov 30, 2018</p>
			<p>I've been working partially remote for the last 3 years and although at times it's been challenging, it's mostly been a success.</p>

			<h2><a href="/k8s-migration/">Kubernetes: Migrating legacy services</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Oct 31, 2018</p>
			<p>Firstly, let me explain what I mean by a legacy service: code that has never run on a container orchestration platform. The chances are your services were designed to run independently, on a node with plenty of resources, without being constantly restarted.</p>

			<h2><a href="/k8s-canary-release/">Kubernetes: Canary release</a></h2>
			<p class="date">May 11, 2018</p>
			<p>Kubernetes makes light work of giving us the ability to deploy a canary release.</p>

			<h2><a href="/k8s-service-ports/">Kubernetes: Service ports</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Apr 5, 2018</p>
			<p>Recently, I've been creating a lot of both internal and internet-facing LoadBalancer Services as this is a great way to expose your cluster to traffic. When doing this on AWS, unless specified otherwise, Kubernetes will automatically create a Classic Load Balancer and attach the relevant instances.</p>

			<h2><a href="/manage-channel-ops/">Manage channel operations using context</a></h2>
			<p class="date">May 5, 2017</p>
			<p>I was recently working on a small personal project when I came across a problem during some testing. I had written an application that starts a HTTP server, accepts requests, and serves content from an in-memory data store.</p>
