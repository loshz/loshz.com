			<h2><a href="/parallel-tests-go/">Parallel tests in Go</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Oct 8, 2019</p>
			<p>A great feature of Go is the ability to run tests in parallel using the default <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">testing package</a>.</p>

			<img src="images/kubecon-18.jpg" title="KubeCon &amp; CloudNativeCon — North America ‘18" />
			<p>With a grand total of 8000 attendees, 150+ speakers, 250+ talks, 100+ sponsors and more swag than I've ever seen at a conference, this was an event not to be missed.</p>

			<h2><a href="/remote-cohesion/">Remote Cohesion</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Nov 30, 2018</p>
			<p>I've been working partially remote for the last 3 years and although at times it's been challenging, it's mostly been a success.</p>

			<h2><a href="/k8s-migration/">Kubernetes: Migrating legacy services</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Oct 31, 2018</p>
			<p>Firstly, let me explain what I mean by a legacy service: code that has never run on a container orchestration platform. The chances are your services were designed to run independently, on a node with plenty of resources, without being constantly restarted.</p>

			<h2><a href="/k8s-canary-release/">Kubernetes: Canary release</a></h2>
			<p class="date">May 11, 2018</p>

			<h2><a href="/k8s-service-ports/">Kubernetes: Service ports</a></h2>
			<p class="date">Apr 5, 2018</p>
			<p>Recently, I've been creating a lot of both internal and internet-facing LoadBalancer Services as this is a great way to expose your cluster to traffic. When doing this on AWS, unless specified otherwise, Kubernetes will automatically create a Classic Load Balancer and attach the relevant instances.</p>

			<h2><a href="/manage-channel-ops/">Manage channel operations using context</a></h2>
			<p class="date">May 5, 2017</p>
			<p>I was recently working on a small personal project when I came across a problem during some testing. I had written an application that starts a HTTP server, accepts requests, and serves content from an in-memory data store.</p>
