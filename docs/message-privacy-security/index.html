	<h2>Message Privacy &amp; Security</h2>
	<p>It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of the many apps used to communicate in today's world, and while you might not pay much attention to the different options available, I want to share <em><strong>why you absolutely should!</strong></em></p>
	<p>I want to keep this as informative and concise as possible, so I'll use the Five Ws:</p>
	<h3>Who should care?</h3>
	<p>EVERYONE.</p>
	<h3>What should you care about?</h3>
	<p>YOUR privacy and security.</p>
	<h3>When should you care?</h3>
	<p>EVERY time you open your phone, computer or tablet to message a friend, loved one, colleague or even a stranger.</p>
	<h3>Where should you care?</h3>
	<p>EVERYWHERE you send a message: in public, at home, in the office, etc.</p>
	<h3>Why should you care at all?</h3>
	<p>This is the most important question- why the hell should you <em>actually</em> care? I'd like to preface this section with the following quote:</p>
	<p class="quote">"I think privacy is a qualified and fundamental human right." - DB</p>
	<p>For example: it would be weird if you noticed someone following you around all the time, right? Or, how about someone taking note of all the items you buy at the store? Alternatively, what about someone copying the photos you take and putting them in their own albums? And then to top it off, these people sold the information to others with you being none the wiser.</p>
	<p>So if you think the above is kind of creepy, what makes doing it online any different? <em>Hint: it's the same thing.</em></p>
	<p>Here's a combined list of just some of the data points, that are tied to your identity, used to stalk you online by many popular messaging apps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Purchase history</li>
		<li>Financial info</li>
		<li>Physical address</li>
		<li>Contacts</li>
		<li>Search history</li>
		<li>Browsing history</li>
		<li>Health and fitness data</li>
		<li>Precise Location</li>
		<li>Photo, video and audio data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now think of all the major, mostly social networking, apps used to communicate today... they almost ALL store the above information about you and use it to influence the content you see online. Whether that be for advertisements, recommendations, profile building, analytics, even political content.</p>
	<p>What about looking at this from a security standpoint. What if all this data were to fall into the wrong hands? It would be rather easy to exploit you or the services you use online.</p>
	<h3>So how can I communicate safer online?</h3>
	<p>I'm glad you asked. There are several messaging apps that claim to be privacy friendly, and while I've personally tried a few, I would highly recommend <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>. Here are just a few reasons why:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Signal is a nonprofit company.</li>
		<li>They do not track, collect or store your personal data online.</li>
		<li>They are 100% End-to-end (E2E) encrypted.</li>
		<li>All of their apps are open-source, meaning ANYONE can view the code used to make them.</li>
		<li>Signal has had many independent Security Reviews by accredited companies and individuals.</li>
		<li>Free to use with zero ads.</li>
		<li>Individual and group voice/video calls.</li>
		<li>Sender verification.</li>
		<li>Multi-device.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
	<p>It can be hard to keep track (pun intended) of your privacy and security online, and nobody has the time to read hundreds of pages of legal terms every time you download an app. The only way to truly protect yourself online is to never use the internet - but that's simply not feasible.</p>
	<p>I wrote this article to encourage you to consider all of the above when communicating online, and it's going to take some time before everyone becomes privy to the facts. So my top 3 recommendations would be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Prefer privacy and security over convenience.</li>
		<li>Review app privacy policies before installing anything.</li>
		<li>Only enable individual app features if they are absolutely needed.</li>
	</ul>
