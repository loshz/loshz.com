<h1>YubiKey: Secure SSH with FIDO2</h1>
<p class="date">2022-12-21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2">OpenSSH 8.2</a> added support for registering and authenticating with FIDO2 Credentials, which is possible on YubiKey series 5 devices. When used for SSH operations, the sensitive part of your SSH key is moved from your computer to an external security key. To get started youâ€™ll need OpenSSH version 8.2 or later, as well as <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2">libfido2</a>.</p>
<h3>Discoverable vs Non-Discoverable Credentials</h3>
<p>Before generating a keypair, you should decide between discoverable (aka resident) or non-discoverable keys. Discoverable credentials means that the private key and associated metadata is stored in persistent memory on the device. For maximum security, choose non-discoverable as the credentials cannot be used if someone else were to steal the physical YubiKey. Non-Discoverable credentials will also require the private key to be stored within the <code>~/.ssh</code> folder of the logged in user as well as the YubiKey.</p>
<p>Yubico has a great <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/Resident_Keys.html">developer guide</a> on this topic.</p>
<h3>Configure YubiKey</h3>
<p>Before creating new keys, optionally reset the FIDO application on the YubiKey. You can do this using the <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager">ykman</a> command:</p>
<p class="quote"><strong>NOTE: THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE, USE WITH CAUTION!</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ ykman fido reset
WARNING! This will delete all FIDO credentials, including FIDO U2F credentials, and restore factory settings. Proceed? [y/N]:
...</code></pre>
<p>Optionally set the PIN for FIDO (required if you want to force verification or manage credentials):</p>
<pre><code>$ ykman fido access change-pin
Enter your new PIN:
...</code></pre>
<h3>Configure Git</h3>
<p>It can be trivial to save your private key on a physical machine, but this isn't secure. Generating keys, for a common use case as Git, is almost identical to the standard <code>ssh-keygen</code> workflow. However, there are a few additional things to note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The "sk" suffix (short for "security key") is appended to the type (<code>-t</code>) value. E.g. <code>ed25519-sk</code> or <code>ecdsa-sk</code>.</li>
	<li>There is a new option to create a discoverable (resident) key: <code>-O resident</code>.</li>
	<li>There is a new option to require the security key PIN in order to use the credentials: <code>-O verify-required</code>.</li>
	<li>Giving the key a name makes it more distinguishable when listing them from the YubiKey. E.g. <code>-O application=ssh:github</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a non-discoverable key without requiring verification, use the following command:<p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C [email] -O application=ssh:github
Generating public/private ed25519-sk key pair.
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.

$ ykman fido credentials list
Enter your PIN:
ssh:github 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 openssh

$ ls ~/.ssh
...
id_ed25519_sk
id_ed25519_sk.pub</code></pre>
<p>You should then be able to add the public key to GitHub and authenticate as usual, entering your PIN and/or touching the YubiKey when prompted:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -T git@github.com
Confirm user presence for key ED25519-SK [key]
User presence confirmed
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</code></pre>
<p>It's worth noting that some operations might require you to touch the YubiKey without bing prompted. When running commands such as <code>git clone</code>, the device light will blink if physical input is required.</p>
